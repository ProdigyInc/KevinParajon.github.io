        Hello, my name is <em>Kevin Parajon</em>. This is my website portfolio, made by me <br><em>(the guy on the right)</em>.
     <em>Fun Fact: I was named after the kid from Home Alone.</em>

    <p style="font-size:1vw" id="indexP">This is a good of a place as any to tell you a little bit about myself. Ever since the young age of 5, I have been in love with computers, and I donâ€™t mean just surfing the web or playing games like club penguin. What I mean by in love with computers is that I have been building and tinkering with programs on the computer for as long as I could remember. I'm not really sure when it all began but computer language and the logic in building a program has always been interesting to me. To be more specific I have always found entertainment in finding the logic behind every single video game I have ever played. My mind goes to how the game works before I recognize how good the game looks.

        In my early years of high school this is where my skills were put to the test the most. I went to Dunbar High School. A school in which I really found my passion for programming. I started off programming how everyone basically starts off using languages such as, HTML and CSS which are languages I can program fluently in. Then later in my sophomore year I dabbled in Javascript which was more of an independent study. However, in my Junior year I learned to program in Python extensively in my <em>AP Computer Science</em> class. To my knowledge the programming language was harder than expected but I succeeded nonetheless. I made algorithms and spoke about real issues in the computer science world.

        The most rewarding experience about my work is that it allows me to be as creative a person as possible. This is why the computer science field has always intrigued me. I enjoy spinning a program or game and making it have my own signature. This is why I am graduating with my degree in Software Engineering at <em>Florida Gulf Coast University</em>. I hope you see this portfolio and feel how much passion I really have for this line of work and for the future of Computer Science.
