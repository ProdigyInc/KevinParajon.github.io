        I have placed alternative text to all of the images, this is so people who are visually impared people do not miss out on any information which images on the site provide.

    <h2 style="font-size:1vw" id="top">Links</h2>
        <p style="font-size:1vw" id="indexP">
        All links on this site open in the same window, so your browser’s ‘back’ button will always work. All Links also work properly and lead to somewhere on the same or other site.
        </p>
    <h2 style="font-size:1vw" id="top">Screen size</h2>
        <p style="font-size:1vw" id="indexP">
        The site has been designed to be easy to use regardless of your screen size. The text flows to the width of your screen, so you are not forced to scroll horizontally to read text if you have a small screen size, and to allow you to enjoy the full width of your screen if you have a larger computer, which also means less vertical scrolling for you.
